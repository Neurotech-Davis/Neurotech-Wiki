What connects all the topics we have covered so far together?

the BCI Pipeline <3

**What is a BCI?**

A brain computer interface, which means some kind of project that incorporates brain signals in performing a task or predicting a result.

**What is a Pipeline?**

A way to represent how different components of your project are "connected" together.

**How would you link components of a project together?**

Using connectors, the special glue. Some modern day examples include bluetooth, usb, electrode gel, python libraries, node-red toolbox, and so many more.

When researching connectors, two key questions to Google:

1. How can [component x] communicate or link with [component y]?
   - see how other people have tried to link these components
2. What are the limitations of using [connector z]?
   - see what problems people have had using this type of connector & their suggestions for alternative connectors

Usually there won't be a direct mention of a "BCI pipeline" in a research paper or open-source project; by the identifying the pipeline steps outline on the next page in these online sources, you can gain ideas for how people went about forming their pipelines.
