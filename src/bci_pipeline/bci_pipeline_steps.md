**How would you link components of a project together?**

Using connectors, the special glue. Some modern day examples include bluetooth, usb, electrode gel, python libraries, node-red toolbox, and so many more.

Two Key Questions To Google When Researching Connectors

1. How can [component x] communicate with [component y]? or How to link [component x] with [component y]?
   - see how other people have tried to link these components
2. What are the limitations of using [connector z]?
   - see what problems people have had using this type of connector & their suggestions for alternative connectors

Usually there won't be a direct mention of a "BCI pipeline" in a research paper or open-source project; however, by the identifying the steps below in these online sources, you can gain ideas for how people went about forming their pipeline.
