# Active, Reference, Ground

The active, reference, and ground are three different types of electrodes that are combined to provide a single channel of EEG. This is because EEG is always recorded as potential for current to pass from one electrode (active) to usually a ground electrode (Luck, 2014, Chapter 5). If this concept of electricity and magnetism is confusing, I highly recommend reading Luck’s second chapter “A Closer Look at ERPs and ERP Components”. The term “absolute voltage…refer[s] to the potential between a given electrode site and the average of the rest of the head”, (Luck, 2014, Chapter 5). What this means is that the potential between the active electrode and the ground electrode is simply the difference between these two absolute electrodes. If you are familiar with basic physics, then you can understand why there is no voltage at a single electrode: you have to have voltage from two sources for everything because voltage is the potential from one source to another. 

For some background when describing the reference electrode, it is important to know that EEG recording systems typically solve the problem of noise in the ground circuit by using what are called differential amplifiers (Luck, 2014, Chapter 5). The reference electrode, in theory, is supposed to be away from the brain activity we are directly measuring, using it to subtract from each active and ground electrode. This makes sense practically, as we are creating a sort of baseline for recording neural activity in order to get rid of any common noise. Here is a section from one of the figures used from Luck in the fifth chapter, that helped me understand this concept:
