Welcome to the Neurotech@Davis Wiki, your comprehensive resource for all things related to neurotechnology. Here you will find learning resources, documentation and guides. 

### What is Neurotech?

Neurotechnology, or Neurotech for short, is a dynamic and multidisciplinary field that harnesses the power of technology to study and interact with the brain and the nervous system. It encompasses a wide range of exciting areas, including:

* Neuroimaging: Explore the world of brain imaging techniques, such as fMRI, EEG, and PET scans, that allow us to peer into the intricacies of the brain.
* Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): Learn about cutting-edge technologies that enable direct communication between the brain and external devices, opening up new possibilities for communication and control.
Signal Processing: Dive into the world of signal processing, where we analyze and make sense of neural data to uncover hidden patterns and insights.
* Machine Learning: Discover how machine learning and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing our understanding of the brain and its functions.
* Deep Learning: Explore the role of deep learning in decoding brain signals and advancing neuroscientific research.
Neuroethical Considerations: Delve into the ethical dimensions of neurotech, including issues related to privacy, consent, and responsible data use.
