# What to do after collecting data?

By Avni Bafna for Neurotech@Davis

After collecting EEG (electroencephalography) data in a neurotech project, there are several important steps you can take to process, analyze, and interpret the data effectively. These steps are:

* Preprocessing the raw data
* Feature Extraction
* Classification

## Why is signal processing necessary?
* Noise Reduction and Artifact Removal: EEG signals are often contaminated with various types of noise, including muscle activity, eye blinks, electrical interference, and environmental noise. Signal processing techniques help to remove or reduce these artifacts, allowing researchers to focus on the brain's electrical activity of interest.
* Enhancing Signal-to-Noise Ratio: EEG signals are relatively weak compared to the background noise. Signal processing methods can amplify the relevant brain signals while suppressing unwanted noise, thus improving the overall signal-to-noise ratio.
* Feature Extraction: Signal processing allows researchers to extract meaningful features from EEG data that correspond to specific brain activities. These features can include frequency components, amplitude variations, and temporal patterns that provide insights into cognitive processes, mental states, and neurological conditions.
* Frequency and Time-Frequency Analysis: Processing allows for the analysis of frequency components and changes over time. Brain activity is often associated with specific frequency bands, and time-frequency analysis helps identify when and where these frequency changes occur during different tasks or conditions.
* Classification and Pattern Recognition: Processed EEG data can be used to train machine learning models for classification tasks. These models can differentiate between different cognitive states, emotions, or clinical conditions based on patterns present in the data.
