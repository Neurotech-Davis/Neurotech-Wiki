# What is a Classifier?

By Avni Bafna for Neurotech@Davis

A classifier is a fundamental component in machine learning that's used to assign labels or categories to input data based on patterns and features present in the data. It's a model that learns from labeled examples in a training dataset and then predicts the labels of new, unseen data. The goal of a classifier is to generalize from the training data to accurately classify unknown instances.

## How does a classifier work?
- Training Phase:
During the training phase, a classifier is presented with a labeled dataset where each data point is associated with a known category or label.
The classifier analyzes the features of the training data and learns to recognize patterns that distinguish different classes.
- Feature Extraction:
Features extracted from the data are important inputs for the classifier. These features might be manually selected, automatically derived, or a combination of both.
- Model Building:
The classifier builds a model based on the relationships between the features and the corresponding labels in the training data.
The model captures the decision boundaries or decision rules that separate different classes in the feature space.
- Prediction Phase:
Once the model is trained, it's used to predict the labels of new, unseen data that was not part of the training dataset.
The classifier applies the learned decision rules to the feature vectors of the new data to make predictions.
- Evaluation:
The accuracy and performance of the classifier are evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.
The classifier's ability to generalize to new, unseen data is a key indicator of its effectiveness.
- Classification Output:
The output of the classifier is the predicted label or class for each input data point.
The classifier assigns a label that it believes is most appropriate based on the patterns it learned during training.

## Types of Classifiers
- Decision Trees: Hierarchical tree-like structures that split data based on feature values.
- Random Forests: Ensembles of decision trees that combine their predictions.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Creates hyperplanes to separate data points of different classes.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Assigns a label to a data point based on the labels of its k-nearest neighbors.
- Naive Bayes: Uses probabilistic models based on Bayes' theorem to predict labels.
- Neural Networks: Complex models that consist of layers of interconnected nodes, known as neurons.
