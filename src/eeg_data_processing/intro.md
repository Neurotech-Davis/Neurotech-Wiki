Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful tool for measuring the brain's electrical activity, capturing real-time data on neural oscillations and cognitive processes. However, raw EEG signals are complex, noisy, and require extensive processing to extract meaningful insights. EEG data processing involves multiple steps, including filtering, artifact removal, feature extraction, and signal classification, to decode patterns of brain activity. Whether used in neuroscience research, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), or clinical diagnostics, effective EEG data processing is essential for translating electrical brain signals into actionable information for understanding and interacting with the brain.
