The haptic feedback BCI is arguably Neurotech@Davisâ€™s most successful and robust BCI to date. This BCI is especially notable for winning 3rd place in the 2023 NeurotechX competition and winning against the likes of UCLA, UC Berkeley, and Rice University.

## What it does

This BCI was also a project that was in development to present at the 2023 Neurotech California Conference. Their BCI project utilized EEG technology to detect loss of focus in students during study and learning sessions. By monitoring the presence of common indicators of focus that consist of ratios of alpha, beta, and gamma waves, They were able to alert the user when their focus began to wane. 

This BCI has utilized several different platforms/technologies: OpenBCI Cyton, Brainflow and Arduino. They were able to develop a simple yet effective solution to use haptic feedback so the user is alerted that their focus is wavering whether it may be towards the end of the session or during the session with a small vibration. 

OpenBCI EEG hardware was used to collect samples of the brain waves which were used to detect focus. The placements of the electrodes consisted of the ground and reference electrodes, prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex which helped aid in the detection of focus.
