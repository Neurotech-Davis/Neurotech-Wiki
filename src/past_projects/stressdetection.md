This BCI project leveraged EEG technology to detect stress by analyzing alpha and beta brainwave activity, providing real-time calming responses through tailored 18.5 Hz music therapy—offering an innovative solution to stress management in everyday life.

## What it does

The main idea of this BCI was to improve the lives of individuals experiencing stress by providing appropriate responses to alleviate its negative effects. Through the utilization of cutting-edge technology, the project was able to detect stress by analyzing the size of alpha and beta activities in the frontal hemisphere and monitoring brain activity in the right frontal hemisphere. Once stress is detected, the BCI is designed to provide calming responses to the user. The team has identified the optimal frequency for focus and concentration to be 18.5 Hz, and we have utilized this frequency to create a calming music response to reduce stress levels.

The project's innovative approach to detecting and alleviating stress provided a unique solution to a common problem. By utilizing EEG signals to detect stress levels and providing real-time appropriate responses, the BCI project aimed to improve the quality of life for individuals who experience stress on a daily basis. The combination of technology and research used in this project provided an effective and efficient method to alleviate stress, which had the potential to be widely applicable in various settings such as educational institutions, workplaces, and healthcare facilities.
